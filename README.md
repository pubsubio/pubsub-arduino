To see the files in the example section of the arduino copy all files to /Documents/libraries/pubsubio/

Load the example and program the arduino with it.

If you cant assign a working ip to the ethernet board. Mac users can go to System Preference > Network > Select Ethernet on the left pane and from the Configure ipv4 drop down list choose 'Using DHCP with manual address' in the IP address box enter an ip in the same subnet mask as the one in your code. If you didnt change the code entering 10.0.0.10 would work.
